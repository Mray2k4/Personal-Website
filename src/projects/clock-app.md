## Summary

A basic clock app with the dates and months writen out. It's mainly Javascript with very little html and css. This project was challenging for me, especially when it came to making the clock tick. It took me a few days but with a lot of trial and errors, watching videos and google, I was able to make the clock tick. That was the highlight of the project and I was very proud of myself for figuring it out. I'm ejoying doing Javascript as its challenging but it gets me excited when using it to manipulate the DOM.
