## Summary

This is a basic calulator app, made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This was one of the mor difficult projects to complete. My main issue was getting the first input(a number clicked) assigned to a variable (num1) and then save it there to use later. I was also having scoping issues too which was one of the reasonsit didn't work initially.I learned to use the .toFix() method as well as the parseFloat() method. Although it took longer than expected, I did learn a great deal from this project. The debugger tool really helped also.
