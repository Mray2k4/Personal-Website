## Summary

A simple todo list with html, css and javascript. This project took longer to complete than expected. I was having trouble using the EventListeners. I couldn't quite get it to work properlY. When I wanted to click on the checkbox to crossout a list and add the delete, it would do it but when I clicked it again it kept added another delete button. I eneded up using the onclick method and that solved my issue. Even though it was frustrating at times I enjoyed learning what works and doesn't work and also using a different approach to get the same results.
