        <p>Hi my name is Marque Ray and I'm on my way to become a Software Developer.
           I was always interested in computers when I was a teen. I didn't know much 
           about coding back then but I liked to learn about software and how to changed 
          the way things looked and worked in the computer. I have been
           an athlete all my life, which had been my main focus, so I decided to have a new focus
           and start my journey as a Software Developer.
